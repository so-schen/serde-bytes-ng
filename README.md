# serde-bytes-ng
Integrate serde_bytes_ng and generic byte array support.

The goal is the contribute to upstream serde_bytes_ng, but because lack of response from its author, 
create a separate crate with generic byte array support plus latest serde_bytes_ng codes so that can
be released as one crate.
